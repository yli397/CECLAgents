# CECL Multi-Agent Simulation Framework
## Agentic Framework for Operational Transparency Analysis

### 🎯 Research Motivation

**Problem Statement**: CECL introduces discretion and complexity in loss estimation, creating opacity concerns among key stakeholders (regulators, auditors, analysts).

**Research Goal**: Understand how operational transparency evolves and reduces institutional tension through strategic stakeholder interactions.

---

### 🏗️ Framework Architecture

**Core Approach**: Agentic framework rooted in institutional and organizational theory, operationalized through multi-agent simulation using LangGraph infrastructure.

#### 🤖 Agent Configuration

| Agent | Role | Objectives | Behavior Rules |
|-------|------|------------|----------------|
| **🏦 BankManagementAgent** | Controls CECL estimation and disclosure policy | • Minimize regulatory scrutiny<br>• Maintain competitive advantage<br>• Balance transparency vs. proprietary risk | Strategic disclosure with feedback integration |
| **🏛️ RegulatoryAgent** | Monitors compliance and applies transparency pressure | • Ensure adequate model validation<br>• Assess systemic risk<br>• Provide improvement guidance | Compliance monitoring with stability focus |
| **📋 AuditorAgent** | Assesses reliability and provides validation feedback | • Evaluate audit trail completeness<br>• Verify methodology and assumptions<br>• Assess control adequacy | Risk-based transparency assessment |
| **📊 AnalystAgent** | Adjusts market confidence based on transparency | • Assess earnings predictability<br>• Evaluate model comparability<br>• Adjust forecast confidence | Market feedback on disclosure quality |
| **🔗 SimulationCoordinatorAgent** | Orchestrates interactions and analyzes outcomes | • Design interaction protocols<br>• Monitor transparency evolution<br>• Analyze convergence dynamics | Multi-round coordination with learning |

### 🔄 Simulation Flow

```
Bank Strategy → Regulatory Assessment → Audit Evaluation → Market Analysis → Coordination → Synthesis
```

**Multi-Round Interaction Protocol:**
1. **Bank issues CECL disclosure** (with transparency level)
2. **Regulators, auditors, and analysts evaluate** and respond
3. **Bank receives feedback** and adjusts policy
4. **Process repeats** → system moves toward stability or conflict

---

### 📊 Key Research Questions

1. **How do strategic interactions among CECL stakeholders evolve transparency norms?**
2. **What feedback loops drive institutional convergence in disclosure practices?**
3. **How does operational transparency reduce stakeholder tensions over time?**
4. **What agent configurations optimize transparency and legitimacy outcomes?**
